      "Cholera is a bacterial infection that causes diarrhea. The cholera bacterium is usually found in water or food contaminated by feces . Cholera is rare in the United States. You may get it if you travel to parts of the world with inadequate water treatment and poor sanitation, and lack of sewage treatment. Outbreaks can also happen after disasters. The disease is not likely to spread directly from one person to another. Often the infection is mild or without symptoms, but sometimes it can be severe. Severe symptoms include profuse watery diarrhea, vomiting, and leg cramps. In severe cases, rapid loss of body fluids leads to dehydration and shock. Without treatment, death can occur within hours. Doctors diagnose cholera with a stool sample or rectal swab. Treatment includes replacing fluid and salts and sometimes antibiotics. Anyone who thinks they may have cholera should seek medical attention immediately. Dehydration can be rapid so fluid replacement is essential. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."

In the 1300s, the \"black death,\" as it was called, killed approximately one-third of europe's population. Today plague is uncommon. This is largely due to better living conditions and antibiotics. There are three forms of plague: bubonic, which causes the tonsils, adenoids, spleen and thymus to become inflamed. Symptoms include fever, aches, chills and tender lymph glands septicemic, in which bacteria multiply in the blood. It causes fever, chills, shock and bleeding under the skin or other organs pneumonic, in which the bacteria enter the lungs and cause pneumonia.

In the 1300s, the \"black death,\" as it was called, killed approximately one-third of europe's population. Today plague is uncommon. This is largely due to better living conditions and antibiotics. There are three forms of plague: bubonic, which causes the tonsils, adenoids, spleen and thymus to become inflamed. Symptoms include fever, aches, chills and tender lymph glands septicemic, in which bacteria multiply in the blood. It causes fever, chills, shock and bleeding under the skin or other organs pneumonic, in which the bacteria enter the lungs and cause pneumonia.

      "Tetanus is a serious illness caused by tetanus bacteria. The bacteria live in soil, saliva, dust and manure. The bacteria usually enter the body through a deep cut, like those you might get from cutting yourself with a knife or stepping on a nail.the infection causes painful tightening of the muscles, usually all over the body. It can lead to \"locking\" of the jaw, which makes it impossible to open your mouth or swallow. If this happens, you could die of suffocation.if you get tetanus, there is usually a long course of treatment. The tetanus vaccine can prevent tetanus but its protection does not last forever. Adults should get a tetanus shot, or booster, every 10 years. If you get a bad cut or burn, see your doctor--you may need a booster."

Meningococci can also cause other problems, including a serious bloodstream infection called sepsis.meningococcal infections can be spread from person to person. They are common in people living in close quarters, such as college students or military recruits.in its early stages, you may have flu-like symptoms and a stiff neck. But the disease can progress quickly and can be fatal. Early diagnosis and treatment are extremely important. Treatment is with antibiotics. Since the infection spreads from person to person, family members may also need to be treated.a vaccine can prevent meningococcal infections."

Sometimes it causes swelling in nearby lymph nodes. If you do not treat it, syphilis usually causes a non-itchy skin rash, often on your hands and feet. Many people do not notice symptoms for years. Symptoms can go away and come back. The sores caused by syphilis make it easier to get or give someone hiv during sex. If you are pregnant, syphilis can cause birth defects, or you could lose your baby.

In both men and women, chlamydia can infect the urinary tract. In women, infection of the reproductive system can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which can cause infertility or serious problems with pregnancy. Babies born to infected mothers can get eye infections and pneumonia from chlamydia. In men, chlamydia can infect the epididymis, the tube that carries sperm. This can cause pain, fever and rarely, infertility. You can cure chlamydia with antibiotics. If you are sexually active, you can decrease your risk of getting it by using condoms.

      "Viral hemorrhagic fevers (vhfs) are a group of illnesses caused by four families of viruses. These include the ebola and marburg viruses and lassa fever virus. Vhfs have common features: they affect many organs, they damage the blood vessels and they affect the body's ability to regulate itself. Some vhfs cause mild disease, but some, like ebola or marburg, cause severe disease and death.vhfs are found around the world. Specific diseases are usually limited to areas where the animals that carry them live. For example, lassa fever is limited to rural areas of west africa where rats and mice carry the virus.the risk for travelers is low, but you should avoid visiting areas where there are disease outbreaks. Because there are no effective treatments for some of these viral infections, there is concern about their use in bioterrorism. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
