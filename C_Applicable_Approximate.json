In almost all cases there is an underlying intraductal breast carcinoma or intraductal and invasive carcinoma. The skin changes range from redness to eczematous appearance.",

It is almost always associated with an intraductal or invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast. The clinical features include focal skin reddening, and eczema. Retraction of the nipple may sometimes occur.",

      "Breast cancer affects one in eight women during their lives. Breast cancer kills more women in the United States than any cancer except lung cancer. No one knows why some women get breast cancer, but there are a number of risk factors. Risks that you cannot change include age - the chance of getting breast cancer rises as a woman gets older genes - there are two genes, brca1 and brca2, that greatly increase the risk. Women who have family members with breast or ovarian cancer may wish to be tested. personal factors - beginning periods before age 12 or going through menopause after age 55other risks include being overweight, using hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy), taking birth control pills, drinking alcohol, not having children or having your first child after age 35 or having dense breasts.symptoms of breast cancer may include a lump in the breast, a change in size or shape of the breast or discharge from a nipple. Breast self-exam and mammography can help find breast cancer early when it is most treatable. Treatment may consist of radiation, lumpectomy, mastectomy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy.men can have breast cancer, too, but the number of cases is small. nih: national cancer institute",

The symptoms of uterine cancer include unusual vaginal bleeding or discharge trouble urinating pelvic pain pain during intercourseuterine cancer usually occurs after menopause. Being obese and taking estrogen-alone hormone replacement therapy (also called menopausal hormone therapy) also increase your risk. Treatment varies depending on your overall health, how advanced the cancer is and whether hormones affect its growth. Treatment is usually a hysterectomy, which is surgery to remove the uterus. The ovaries and fallopian tubes are also removed. Other options include hormone therapy and radiation. nih: national cancer institute",

Some of the most common are headaches, usually worse in the morning nausea and vomiting changes in your ability to talk, hear, or see problems with balance or walking problems with thinking or memory muscle jerking or twitching numbness or tingling in arms or legsdoctors diagnose brain tumors by doing a neurologic exam and tests including an mri, ct scan, and biopsy.

The nasal cavity is the passageway just behind your nose through which air passes on the way to your throat as you breathe.cancer of the nasal cavity and paranasal sinuses is rare. Men are more likely than women to get it, and most patients are older than 45. There may be no symptoms at first, and later symptoms can be like those of infections. This means the cancer may not be found until it is advanced, making it harder to treat. Treatment options include surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. nih: national cancer institute"

      "Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. nih: national cancer institute",

          "A tumor composed of atypical neoplastic, often pleomorphic cells that invade other tissues. Malignant neoplasms often metastasize to distant anatomic sites and may recur after excision. The most common malignant neoplasms are carcinomas (adenocarcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas), hodgkin and non-hodgkin lymphomas, leukemias, melanomas, and sarcomas.",
          "Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. nih: national cancer institute",
          "New abnormal tissue that grows by excessive cellular division and proliferation more rapidly than normal and continues to grow after the stimuli that initiated the new growth cease; tumors perform no useful body function and may be benign or malignant; benign neoplasms are a noncancerous growth that does not invade nearby tissue or spread to other parts of the body; malignant neoplasms or cancer show a greater degree of anaplasia and have the properties of invasion and metastasis; neoplasm terms herein do not distinguish between benign or malignant states, use references listed to cover this concept."

One group has an alpha/beta, cd8 positive phenotype, involves only subcutaneous tissues, and usually has an indolent clinical course. The second group has a gamma/delta phenotype, is cd8 negative, often co-expresses cd56, is not confined to the subcutaneous tissues, and usually has a poor prognosis. In the recent who-eortc classification, the term subcutaneous panniculitis-like t-cell lymphoma is reserved for cases with an alpha/beta, cd8 positive phenotype. Cases with a gamma/delta phenotype are included in the group of cutaneous gamma/delta t-cell lymphomas."

          "A clinical variant of langerhans cell histiocytosis characterised by unifocal involvement of a bone (most often), skin, or lung. Patients are usually older children or adults usually presenting with a lytic bone lesion. The etiology is unknown. Morphologically, eosinophilic granuloma is characterised by the presence of langerhans cells in a characteristic milieu which includes histiocytes, eosinophiles neutrophiles, and small, mature lymphocytes.",
          "A group of disorders resulting from the abnormal proliferation of and tissue infiltration by langerhans cells which can be detected by their characteristic birbeck granules (x bodies), or by monoclonal antibody staining for their surface cd1 antigens. Langerhans-cell granulomatosis can involve a single organ, or can be a systemic disorder.",
          "A group of rare disorders in which too many langerhans cells (a type of white blood cell) grow in certain tissues and organs including the bones, skin, and lungs, and damage them. Langerhans cell histiocytosis may also affect the pituitary gland (which makes hormones that control other glands and many body functions, especially growth). Langerhans cell histiocytosis is most common in children and young adults.",
          "A multifocal, multisystem form of langerhans-cell histiocytosis. There is involvement of multiple organ systems including the bones, skin, liver, spleen, and lymph nodes. Patients are usually infants presenting with fever, hepatosplenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, bone and skin lesions, and pancytopenia.",
          "A multifocal, unisystem form of langerhans-cell histiocytosis. There is involvement of multiple sites in one organ system, most frequently the bone. Patients are usually young children presenting with multiple destructive bone lesions.",
          "A neoplastic proliferation of langerhans cells which contain birbeck granules by ultrastructural examination. Three major overlapping syndromes are recognized: eosinophilic granuloma, letterer-siwe disease, and hand-schuller-christian disease. The clinical course is generally related to the number of organs affected at presentation. (who, 2001)",
