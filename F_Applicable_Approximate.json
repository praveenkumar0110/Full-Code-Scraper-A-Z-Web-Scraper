      "What: organic brain syndrome. Organic brain syndrome: either a long term deterioration of intellectual function and memory (dementia) or a short term disturbance of orientation, judgement, or consciousness (delirium). Both may be marked by illusions, hallucinations, delusions, or disturbances of perceptions, mood, behavior, cognitive capacity, or personality. Why: delirium can occur with rheumatic fever or cerebral vasculitis. Both delirium and dementia can occur in systemic lupus erythematosus, and rarely also in mixed connective tissue disease. How: ten or more incorrect responses to the following 30 questions usually means an organic impairment exists. 1) what day of the week is this? 15) the opposite of fast is slow. 2) what month? the opposite of up is? 3) what day of the month? 16) the opposite of large is? 4) what year? 17) the opposite of hard is? 5) what place is this? 18) an orange and a banana are 6) repeat these numbers 8 7 2.

      "Bipolar disorder is a serious mental illness. People who have it go through unusual mood changes. They go from very happy, \"up,\" and active to very sad and hopeless, \"down,\" and inactive, and then back again. They often have normal moods in between. The up feeling is called mania. The down feeling is depression. The causes of bipolar disorder aren't always clear. It runs in families. Abnormal brain structure and function may also play a role. Bipolar disorder often starts in a person's late teen or early adult years. But children and adults can have bipolar disorder too. The illness usually lasts a lifetime.if you think you may have it, tell your health care provider. A medical checkup can rule out other illnesses that might cause your mood changes.if not treated, bipolar disorder can lead to damaged relationships, poor job or school performance, and even suicide. However, there are effective treatments to control symptoms: medicine and talk therapy. A combination usually works best."

It affects 3-5 percent of all american children.the main features of adhd are inattention hyperactivity impulsivityno one knows exactly what causes adhd. It sometimes runs in families, so genetics may be a factor. There may also be environmental factors.a complete evaluation by a trained professional is the only way to know for sure if your child has adhd. Treatment may include medicine to control symptoms, therapy, or both. Structure at home and at school is important. Parent training may also help.",
