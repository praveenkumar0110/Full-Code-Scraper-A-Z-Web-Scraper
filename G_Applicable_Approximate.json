Eventually intellectual impairment; loss of fine motor control; athetosis; and diffuse chorea involving axial and limb musculature develops, leading to a vegetative state within 10-15 years of disease onset. The juvenile variant has a more fulminant course including seizures; ataxia; dementia; and chorea. (from Adams et al., Principles of Neurology, 6th ed, pp1060-4)",

      "Huntington's disease (hd) is an inherited disease that causes certain nerve cells in the brain to waste away. People are born with the defective gene, but symptoms usually don't appear until middle age. Early symptoms of hd may include uncontrolled movements, clumsiness or balance problems. Later, hd can take away the ability to walk, talk or swallow. Some people stop recognizing family members. Others are aware of their environment and are able to express emotions.if one of your parents has huntington's disease, you have a 50-50 chance of getting it. A blood test can tell if you have the hd gene and will develop the disease. Genetic counseling can help you weigh the risks and benefits of taking the test.there is no cure. Medicines can help manage some of the symptoms, but cannot slow down or stop the disease."

In other cases, rls is caused by a disease or condition, such as anemia or pregnancy. Some medicines can also cause temporary rls. Caffeine, tobacco and alcohol may make symptoms worse.lifestyle changes, such as regular sleep habits, relaxation techniques and moderate exercise during the day can help.

Lewy body disease happens when abnormal structures, called lewy bodies, build up in areas of the brain. The disease may cause a wide range of symptoms, including changes in alertness and attention hallucinations problems with movement and posture muscle stiffness confusion loss of memorylewy body disease can be hard to diagnose, because parkinson's disease and alzheimer's disease cause similar symptoms. Scientists think that lewy body disease might be related to these diseases, or that they sometimes happen together.lewy body disease usually begins between the ages of 50 and 85. The disease gets worse over time. There is no cure. Treatment focuses on drugs to help symptoms.",

People may have strange sensations and emotions or behave strangely. They may have violent muscle spasms or lose consciousness. Epilepsy has many possible causes, including illness, brain injury and abnormal brain development. In many cases, the cause is unknown.doctors use brain scans and other tests to diagnose epilepsy. It is important to start treatment right away. There is no cure for epilepsy, but medicines can control seizures for most people. When medicines are not working well, surgery or implanted devices such as vagus nerve stimulators may help. Special diets can help some children with epilepsy."

      "If you suffer from migraine headaches, you're not alone. About 12 percent of the United States Population gets them. Migraines are recurring attacks of moderate to severe pain. The pain is throbbing or pulsing, and is often on one side of the head. During migraines, people are very sensitive to light and sound. They may also become nauseated and vomit. Migraine is three times more common in women than in men. Some people can tell when they are about to have a migraine because they see flashing lights or zigzag lines or they temporarily lose their vision. Many things can trigger a migraine. These include anxiety stress lack of food or sleep exposure to light hormonal changes (in women)doctors used to believe migraines were linked to the opening and narrowing of blood vessels in the head. Now they believe the cause is related to genes that control the activity of some brain cells. Medicines can help prevent migraine attacks or help relieve symptoms of attacks when they happen. For many people, treatments to relieve stress can also help.",

Why: mononeuritis multiplex can occur in polyarteritis if the nutrient arteries of peripheral nerve trunks are involved by the disease. How: the patient with mononeuritis multiplex may present with motor or sensory changes which occur in an irregular and asymmetrical distribution on his body. These changes may be areas of paresthesia or anesthesia, loss of deep tendon reflexes, weakness or paralysis of muscle group. For example, a typical patient might present with paresthesia of the radial aspect of his left hand representing involvement of the left median nerve and weakness of his right foot and ankle representing right tibial nerve involvement.

In the United States, cmt affects about 1 in 3,300 people. Cmt affects your peripheral nerves. Peripheral nerves carry movement and sensation signals between the brain and spinal cord and the rest of the body. Symptoms usually start around the teen years. Foot problems such as high arches or hammertoes can be early symptoms. As cmt progresses, your lower legs may weaken. Later, your hands may also become weak. There is no cure. The disease can be so mild you don't realize you have it or severe enough to make you weak. Many people with cmt lead active lives and have a normal life span. Physical therapy, occupational therapy, braces and other devices and sometimes surgery can help you cope. genetics home reference",

The pns nerves connect your brain and spinal cord with the rest of your body. Damage to these nerves makes it hard for them to transmit signals. As a result, your muscles have trouble responding to your brain. No one knows what causes the syndrome. Sometimes it is triggered by an infection, surgery or a vaccination. The first symptom is usually weakness or a tingling feeling in your legs. The feeling can spread to your upper body. In severe cases, you become almost paralyzed. This is life-threatening. You might need a respirator to breathe. Symptoms usually worsen over a period of weeks, then stabilize. Most people recover. Recovery can take a few weeks to a few years. Treatment options during the symptom period include medicines or a procedure called plasma exchange.",

Usually they do not get worse over time. People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty walking. They may also have trouble with tasks such as writing or using scissors. Some have other medical conditions, including seizure disorders or mental impairment. Cerebral palsy happens when the areas of the brain that control movement and posture do not develop correctly or get damaged. Early signs of cerebral palsy usually appear before 3 years of age. Babies with cerebral palsy are often slow to roll over, sit, crawl, smile, or walk. Some babies are born with cerebral palsy; others get it after they are born. There is no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. Treatment includes medicines, braces, and physical, occupational and speech therapy.",

Usually they do not get worse over time. People with cerebral palsy may have difficulty walking. They may also have trouble with tasks such as writing or using scissors. Some have other medical conditions, including seizure disorders or mental impairment. Cerebral palsy happens when the areas of the brain that control movement and posture do not develop correctly or get damaged. Early signs of cerebral palsy usually appear before 3 years of age. Babies with cerebral palsy are often slow to roll over, sit, crawl, smile, or walk. Some babies are born with cerebral palsy; others get it after they are born. There is no cure for cerebral palsy, but treatment can improve the lives of those who have it. Treatment includes medicines, braces, and physical, occupational and speech therapy.",
