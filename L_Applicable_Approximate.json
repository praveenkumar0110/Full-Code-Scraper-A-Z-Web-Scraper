It is most common in children between the ages of two and six. It usually starts when bacteria get into a break in the skin, such as a cut, scratch or insect bite. Symptoms start with red or pimple-like sores surrounded by red skin. These sores can be anywhere, but usually they occur on your face, arms and legs. The sores fill with pus, then break open after a few days and form a thick crust. They are often itchy, but scratching them can spread the sores. Impetigo can spread by contact with sores or nasal discharge from an infected person. You can treat impetigo with antibiotics."

The appearance of the mucocutaneous lesions is preceded by an upper respiratory tract infection.

          "What: erythema marginatum. Erythema marginatum: an evanescent, erythematous rash characteris- tically (though not commonly) seen in the early stages of rheumatic fever. The rash is not limited to rheumatic fever, however, and has also been reported in patients with allergic drug reactions, sepsis and glomerulonephritis. Why: although the rash is not pathognomonic of rheumatic fever, its presence is helpful in conjunction with other manifestations of rheumatic fever, particularly carditis with which it is most often associated. How: the rash is characterized by pink, evanescent, slightly raised small macules with a sharply demarcated and irregular border. The erythematous areas often have pale centers. The rash commonly occurs over the trunk and inner aspects of the upper arms and thighs, but never on the face. It is non-painful and rarely pruritic, may appear and disappear in a matter of hours only to return, and may be brought out by a hot bath or shower. The rash blanches on pressure, and is a transient rash which tends to migrate from place to place. Refs: 1) jones criteria (revised) for guidance in the diagnosis of rheumatic fever.

It is more common in people with autoimmune diseases, and it might run in families. It usually starts before age 40. The white patches are more common where your skin is exposed to the sun. In some cases, the patches spread. Vitiligo can cause your hair to gray early. If you have dark skin, you may lose color inside your mouth. Using sunscreen will help protect your skin, and cosmetics can cover up the patches. Treatments for vitiligo include medicines, light therapy and surgery. Not every treatment is right for everyone.

They commonly form where your bones are close to your skin, such as your ankles, back, elbows, heels and hips. You are at risk if you are bedridden, use a wheelchair, or are unable to change your position. Pressure sores can cause serious infections, some of which are life-threatening.

          "A chronic disorder, possibly autoimmune, marked by excessive production of collagen which results in hardening and thickening of body tissues. Localized scleroderma typically affects the skin, with formation of patches or lines of thick and unyielding tissue; there can be muscle and underlying tissue involvement as well as occasional joint complications. The affected areas of skin can be restrictive and disfiguring. The shape, depth and location of the affected area is used to classify one of the four types of local scleroderma. An individual can have a combination of localized scleroderma types.",
          "A term used to describe a variety of localized asymmetrical skin thickening that is similar to those of systemic scleroderma but without the disease features in the multiple internal organs and blood vessels. Lesions may be characterized as patches or plaques (morphea), bands (linear), or nodules."
