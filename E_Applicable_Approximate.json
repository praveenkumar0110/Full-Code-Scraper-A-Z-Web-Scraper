          "Your thyroid is a butterfly-shaped gland in your neck, just above your collarbone. It is one of your endocrine glands, which make hormones. The thyroid helps set your metabolism - how your body gets energy from the foods you eat.millions of people in the United States Have thyroid diseases. Most of them are women. If you have a thyroid disease, your body uses energy more slowly or quickly than it should. A thyroid gland that is not active enough, called hypothyroidism, is far more common. It can make you gain weight, feel fatigued and have difficulty dealing with cold temperatures. If your thyroid is too active, it makes more thyroid hormones than your body needs. That condition is hyperthyroidism. Too much thyroid hormone can make you lose weight, speed up your heart rate and make you very sensitive to heat. There are many causes for both conditions. Treatment involves trying to reset your body's metabolism to a normal rate."

Symptoms may include being very thirsty urinating often feeling very hungry or tired losing weight without trying having sores that heal slowly having dry, itchy skin losing the feeling in your feet or having tingling in your feet having blurry eyesight a blood test can show if you have diabetes.

Type i in which there is no increase in the urinary excretion of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp) and phosphate in response to parathyroid hormone (pth). Type ii in which there is a response to pth, but without phosphate diuresis. The erythrocytes of some patients with type i contain a defective receptor-cyclase coupling protein (stimulatory guanine nucleoside-binding protein, or gs) which is responsible for coupling the cellular receptor that binds parathyroid hormone (pth) and is involved with the formation and release of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (camp). This variant has been designated as \"pseudohypoparathyroidism type ia.\" the syndrome is associated with mental deficiency, dystrophic bone lesions, short stature, and other defects."

Both terms mean that a person's weight is greater than what's considered healthy for his or her height. Obesity occurs over time when you eat more calories than you use. The balance between calories-in and calories-out differs for each person. Factors that might tip the balance include your genetic makeup, overeating, eating high-fat foods and not being physically active. Being obese increases your risk of diabetes, heart disease, stroke, arthritis and some cancers. If you are obese, losing even 5 to 10 percent of your weight can delay or prevent some of these diseases."

          "Tay-sachs disease is a rare, inherited disorder. It causes too much of a fatty substance to build up in tissues and nerve cells of the brain. This buildup destroys the nerve cells, causing mental and physical problems. Infants with tay-sachs disease appear to develop normally for the first few months of life. Then, as nerve cells become distended with fatty material, mental and physical abilities deteriorate. The child becomes blind, deaf, and unable to swallow. Muscles begin to atrophy and paralysis sets in. Even with the best of care, children with tay-sachs disease usually die by age 4.tay-sachs is most common in eastern european ashkenazi jews. A blood test can determine if you carry or have the disease. There is no cure. Medicines and good nutrition can help some symptoms. Some children need feeding tubes."

The extra iron can damage your organs. Without treatment, it can cause your organs to fail. The most common treatment is to remove some blood, just like when you donate blood. This is called therapeutic phlebotomy. Medicines may also help remove the extra iron. Your doctor might suggest some changes in your diet.",
          "What: hemochromatosis: hemochromatosis: a disorder of iron metabolism characterized by excess deposition of iron in the tissues, especially the liver. It is characterized by pigmentation of the skin, hepatic cirrhosis, decreased carbohydrate tolerance, cardiomyopathy and endocrinopathy (especially hypogonadism). Mainly seen in men over the age of 40 years. It has an associated arthropathy distinguished by involvement of the metacarpophalangeal joints (particularly the second and third), wrists, knees, shoulders, and hips. There is often an associated chondrocalcinosis. Why: hemochromatosis is an autosomal recessive disease that produces an arthritis similar to osteoarthritis or pseudogout. How: hemochromatosis is diagnosed by the typical physical and radiographic findings supported by elevated serum iron concentrations and high transferrin saturations. Serum ferritin is also markedly elevated. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be done by demonstrating hepatic iron deposition on liver biopsy."
