Many people with spina bifida will need assistive devices such as braces, crutches or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties, urinary and bowel problems or hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the brain. There is no cure. Treatments focus on the complications, and can include surgery, medicine and physiotherapy. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins.

These malformations range from mild (e.g., spina bifida occulta) to severe, including rachischisis where there is complete failure of neural tube and spinal cord fusion, resulting in exposure of the spinal cord at the surface. Spinal dysraphism includes all forms of spina bifida. The open form is called spina bifida cystica and the closed form is spina bifida occulta. (from Joynt, Clinical Neurology, 1992, ch55, p34)",

          "Spina bifida is the most common disabling birth defect in the United States. It is a type of neural tube defect, which is a problem with the spinal cord or its coverings. It happens if the fetal spinal column doesn't close completely during the first month of pregnancy. There is usually nerve damage that causes at least some paralysis of the legs. Many people with spina bifida will need assistive devices such as braces, crutches or wheelchairs. They may have learning difficulties, urinary and bowel problems or hydrocephalus, a buildup of fluid in the brain. There is no cure. Treatments focus on the complications, and can include surgery, medicine and physiotherapy. Taking folic acid can reduce the risk of having a baby with spina bifida. It's in most multivitamins. Women who could become pregnant should take it daily."

          "A cyst is a fluid-filled sac. There are two types of kidney cysts. Polycystic kidney disease (pkd) runs in families. In pkd, the cysts take the place of the normal tissue. They enlarge the kidneys and make them work poorly, leading to kidney failure. When pkd causes kidneys to fail - which usually happens after many years - people need dialysis or kidney transplantation. About half of people with the most common type of pkd end up with kidney failure. Pkd also causes cysts in other parts of the body, such as the liver. Symptoms of pkd includepain in the back and lower sidesheadachesurinary tract infectionsblood in the urinedoctors diagnose pkd with imaging tests and family history. Treatments include medications, and, when people with pkd develop kidney failure, dialysis or kidney transplants.acquired cystic kidney disease (ackd) usually happens in people who are on dialysis. Unlike pkd, the kidneys are normal sized, and cysts do not form in other parts of the body. People with ackd already have chronic kidney disease when they develop cysts. Ackd often has no symptoms. In most cases, the cysts are harmless and do not need treatment.",

The phenotype is variable and the affected infants may show different clusters of abnormalities. A proposed classification identifies three distinct categories of this syndrome: type i (classic) is marked by prenatal growth deficiency becoming more severe after birth, moderate to profound psychomotor retardation, and severe malformations usually leading to disability or death; type ii (mild) is characterized by facial and skeletal abnormalities which are similar to those in type i but are much less severe, moderate pre- and postnatal growth retardation, and the absence of major malformations; and type iii in which phenotypic manifestations are related to chromosomal aneuploidies or teratogenic factors. The syndrome was first observed in amsterdam, hence its synonyms amsterdam dwarf, amsterdam type, and typus amstelodamensis.

Unilateral lesions of the legs with cutaneous and subcutaneous hemangiomas, varicosities, phlebectasis and occasional arteriovenous fistulae were emphasized in earlier reports, but later findings indicate involvement of many other parts of the body. Vascular anomalies may be present at birth or may appear in infancy. Occasional associated abnormalities may include lymphangiomatous anomalies, limb deformities, cutis marmorata, micro- or macrocephaly, eye diseases, and craniofacial deformities. Most patients have normal mentality, except when vascular lesions invade the cerebral tissue. In the absence of arteriovenous fistulae, the syndrome is often referred to as weber syndrome or parkes weber syndrome. Klippel-trenaunay-weber syndrome is associated in some cases with sturge-weber angiomatosis."

Associated anomalies may included webbed neck, cubitus valgus, shield chest, short stature, lymphedema, coarctation of the aorta, pigmented nevi, and various renal, skeletal, dermatologic, neoplastic, and autoimmune complications.
